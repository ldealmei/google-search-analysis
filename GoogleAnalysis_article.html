<h4 class="w3-opacity">Text Mining my search history</h4>
<p class="w3-justify">Recently, there has been increased emphasis on data privacy and abuses by tech giants keep being revealed (<a href="https://qz.com/1131515/google-collects-android-users-locations-even-when-location-services-are-disabled/">for example</a>). Also, with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) coming in Europe next spring, the industry is focusing more on the question.</p>
<p class="w3-justify">Being relatively new to data science and concerned by the data privacy issue, I was curious and decided to take a look at what data tech giants actually collected about me. Conveniently, Facebook and Google both allow to download all the data linked to our profile that they store.</p>
<p class="w3-justify">I am aware that, due to the fact that I am an Android user, Google probably has an enormous amount of data on me. However, it is impressive to see the 35 Go of personal information in a single archive.</p>
<p class="w3-justify">What can we find there? Everything related to the use of a Google Service : Everything that is in my Google Calendar, Gmail, Drive, Chrome, … (see Fig. 1) </p>
<img src="google_services.png" class="w3-round" alt="[missing image]" width="800px">
<p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i>Fig. 1. An overview of the different Google Services currently available.</i></p>
<p class="w3-justify">Though we don’t actively use all of these services we surely do use a subset and the combined information collected is extremely valuable.</p>
<p class="w3-justify">Google actually provides a way to explore the data they have stored through the <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard">Google Dashboard</a>. One of the most impressive parts of this Dashboard is the exploration tool of our location history. This <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/timeline">Timeline</a> interactively shows us how we spent our days. Where we were, when we were there, how we moved from one place to another and it can even embellish it all with the pictures we took at the moment.</p>
<img src="google_dashboard.png" class="w3-round" alt="[missing image]" width="800px">
<p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i>Fig. 2. Snapshot of my Timeline on 22 august 2016. Red dots are the raw location information.</i></p>
<p class="w3-justify">This example illustrates clearly how much personal information it contains. From this simple snapshot, one can infer where I live, work, do my shopping… Combined with the rest, we can easily derive my living habits, which places I currently go to, etc.</p>
<p class="w3-justify">Marketers are constantly looking for new opportunities to sell and the value of location data has not flown under their radar (see <a href="https://adexchanger.com/mobile/mwc-2016-theres-value-location-data-still-bumpy-road/">this</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesinsights/2017/01/19/location-intelligence-mapping-the-opportunities-in-the-data-landscape/#506b804e1bc6">this</a>). This type of data is not considered as 'sensitive' by GDPR, however, there is immense information in it because of the unique patterns it reveals (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01376">Unique in the Crowd: The privacy bounds of human mobility</a>). </p>
<p class="w3-justify">There is much to discuss on location data but for the rest of the article, I want to focus on  another type of data that can be even more valuable, our Google searches. </p>
<h3 class="w3-justify">Google Searches </h3>
<p class="w3-justify">What we ask Google throughout the day reflects everything that goes on in our lives. We ask Google when we need information related to our work, we ask Google when we are curious about something, we ask Google when we want to find a specific something.  Most of what goes on in our heads, goes through Google servers.</p>
<p class="w3-justify">Therefore I was curious to find out how much can really be inferred of my interests, and personality by analyzing my search history.</p>
<p class="w3-justify">What is interesting with working with search data is that, if we don’t know what we are looking for, it has little value as such. However with a little processing and the help of Text Mining techniques - which allow to unveil trends and pattern in text data - we can get strong insights into the person’s interests and area of work, just to mention a few. With some further processing, the time dimension can also be included into the results and give an idea of when a specific topic was of interest and even give a relative notion of how strong this interest was.</p>
<h3 class="w3-justify">The Analysis</h3>
<p class="w3-justify">Topic detection algorithms (e.g. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Non-Negative Matrix Factorization) allow us to get great insights from this data. The purpose of topic detection algorithms is to find combinations of words (a topic) that appear in the text. The topics found can then be interpreted. For example, the topic composed of the words : cell, life, organism, science, growth, mitosis,… suggests 'Biology'. If such a combination of words would come forward in the analysis of documents, we could infer that those have some content related to biology.</p>
<img src="topic_detection_viz.png" class="w3-round" alt="[missing image]" width="800px">
<p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i>Fig. 3. High-level overview of the workflow of a topic detection analysis. *tf : Weighting by Term frequency; tfidf : Weigthing by Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency.</i></p>
<p class="w3-justify">For this analysis, the data we have are the keywords I used when querying Google. However, this is not sufficient to get meaningful results. A first step is to create a corpus (a set of documents) to serve as input to our analysis. For each query, a document composed of the descriptive text of the first page of google search results (see Fig. 4.) is built. This allows to have a set of words related to my query and makes it easier to find links between queries.</p>

<p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i>Fig. 4. Building the document for the query "number 42".</i></p>
<p class="w3-justify">After some processing, we can apply a classical topic detection algorithm and let the magic happen. Note that these algorithms require to fix the number of topics we want to find. Here it was fixed at 20.</p>
<p class="w3-justify">For those that are more interested in the technicalities and implementation of the analysis, the source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ldealmei/google-search-analysis">my Github page</a></p>
<h3 class="w3-justify">Results</h3>
<p class="w3-justify">The interactive plot hereunder displays in a 2D frame (through multidimensional scaling) the different topics extracted. The size of the bubble is proportional to the number of queries associated to the topic. Grey bubbles are anonymized. You can click on a bubble to display the associated wordcloud.</p>

</div>
<p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i>Note : The names of the topics are given a posteriori based on the word clouds.</i></p>
<p class="w3-justify">The next plot adds the temporal dimension and gives an indication of when I was interested in a certain topic and to what extent. This is here demonstrated for the topic concerning "Diffusion Tensor Imaging" which was at the center of my <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nbm.3793/abstract;jsessionid=7A1F9BC72EEC106CB04AE51F8A631464.f02t02">master thesis</a>.</p>

</div>
<p class="w3-justify">If you played around with the visualizations, you must have noted that the topics that stick out of the analysis are coherent and they really stress important aspects of my (online) life  : music, Montreal, my thesis (through diffusion tensor imaging, image registration). More specific interests also show up (e.g. polyphasic sleep).</p>
<p class="w3-justify">This preliminary analysis was conducted on a subset of my search data (<10%) and yet there is a significant number of valuable insights concerning my interests.</p>

<p class="w3-justify">This analysis emphasizes the extent to which sensitive information can be extracted from our data with a little bit of code. This kind of analysis is something rather common in the field of Data Science and does not require high expertise levels.</p>
<p class="w3-justify">Even if we think that nobody will ever attempt to do an analysis on our data (which is probably the case), the simple fact that it is <i>possible</i> should encourage caution. Particularly when misuse of personal data is more common than one might think (through breaches or simple clumsiness, see this <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/940051734650503168">Netflix tweet</a>).</p>

<p class="w3-justify">When things reach such a scale we should reflect on whether what we share is really worth the actual improvement in services. And if not, we should strive to limit the amount of data we freely share about ourselves. </p>
